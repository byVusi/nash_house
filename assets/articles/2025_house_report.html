						<h1 style="margin-top: 5rem">What is Nash House?</h1>
						<p class="subtitle text-muted">
							Mila Xego, Head of House
						</p>
						<br />

						<p>
							On the surface Nash house is a boarding and day-boy
							house that was Established in 1907 being named after
							The Rt Rev James Okey Nash who was Headmaster of St
							John's College from 1906-1917 and Coadjutor Bishop
							of Cape Town from 1917-1930.
						</p>

						<p>
							However those in Nash know that the House is much
							more than what was just stated. It is more than a
							house within the St Johns House System or a boarding
							house. Nash house is a community, a family and a
							legacy that every College Boy, that is lucky enough
							to call himself a “Nashtonian”, carries with an
							immense sense of pride. To be a part of Nash means
							that you are a part of something bigger than
							yourself, something that demands dedication, loyalty
							and spirit.
						</p>

						<p>
							The words “A dream for many, a reality for few”,
							which are closely related to the house, captures
							exactly what it means to wear the iconic blue and
							white Nash colours. To be in Nash is not about the
							bare minimum - it is about living up to the
							standards, traditions and values that make the House
							not just any other House but Nash house. Many people
							dream of being a part of something so full and rich
							with heritage and culture, but only a few have the
							honour of calling themselves a Nashtonian. But as
							the saying goes “With great power (honour) comes
							great responsibility”: to give your best, to support
							your fellow Nashtonians and uphold the pride of the
							house in everything we do.
						</p>

						<p>
							The house Motto, “Conando Vincimus” (By striving, we
							conquer) is a constant reminder that success does
							not come easily just because one is in Nash House.
							Success is earned through hard work, persistence and
							resilience. Every Nashtonian needs to understand
							that victories are forged in the countless hours of
							effort and preparation behind the scenes. We conquer
							not only through competition, but through the
							character and unity we show along through our
							journey through the College.
						</p>

						<p>
							To be a Nashtonian is to embrace this spirit: the
							courage to dream, the strength to strive and the
							will to overcome challenges. Nash house is where
							individuals become part of a family, where struggles
							and challenges turn into opportunities and where
							success (no matter how small) belongs to every
							single Nashtonian.
						</p>

						<h2>Personal achievements</h2>

						<p>
							Nashtonians are well known for their high level of
							achievements within the College, whether it be
							playing in a first team or earning colours and
							honours. However, this year, a few Nashtonians
							soared above all expectations and made a significant
							impact on provincial and national stages. Allan
							Njangfang Patu (UIV), who played both first team
							basketball and for the mighty Blues despite only
							being in UIV, was selected to represent the Golden
							Lions U17 Welpies side and was named to the BNL
							Schools All-Star Team. Similarly, basketball phenom
							Ama Ntsubane (LV) also earned a place on the BNL
							Schools All-Star Team following his many stellar
							performances for the Blues on the court. Young Max
							Baxter (REM) took the competitive shooting world by
							storm, defeating the UK's top two ranked marksmen
							and narrowly missing first place in an under-16
							tournament, despite being only 13 years old at the
							time.Congratulations also go to Alec Loveland for
							earning 100 caps for the 1st Team cricket side,
							joining Nashtonian legends Joe Macrobert and Devon
							Conway as only the 13th player in College history to
							reach this remarkable milestone. This achievement
							stands as a testament to Alec's dedication, skill,
							and consistency at the highest level of College
							cricket.
						</p>

						<h2>
							Some notable achievements from a House perspective
						</h2>

						<p>
							Over this past year, the spirit of competition truly
							ignited the light of Nashtonian Brotherhood like
							never before. One of the most memorable new
							traditions was born as the boarders gathered in the
							common room to learn and practice new war cries in
							preparation for IH swimming, especially the highly
							contested Spirit Cup. While this lively noise was at
							times a disturbance to neighboring houses and
							stooges, it undeniably fostered a strong sense of
							camaraderie and unity that deserves high
							commendation. Nash House has long been known for its
							rugby prowess, and after a challenging start in all
							Inter-House competitions, rugby became our chance to
							claim a first win. The boys rose to the occasion,
							securing our first IH competition victory, which
							filled the entire house with joy and excitement.
							This triumph marked the beginning of what the boys
							affectionately called “la Remontada,” or the
							comeback, as we went on to win IH hockey, IH rugby,
							and IH athletics despite a tough year.
						</p>

						<p>
							Another highlight was the Inter-House drama
							performance, where Nash came 2nd overall. Lehakoe
							Matlala (LV) wrote the script, which won Best
							Original Script, and Makutuma Mothabela (LV)
							directed the production. Cast members Tiri
							Pasipanodya earned Overall Best Actor, while Koketso
							and Thato Phatudi won Best Duo, showcasing the
							amazing talent and creativity within Nash House.
						</p>

						<p>
							However, not all results were as successful.
							Finishing 9th in Inter-House Music and 7th in
							Inter-House Swimming was a disappointment, falling
							short of the standards Nash House strives for. These
							placements served as a reminder that while our
							strengths shone in certain areas, there remains
							important work to be done to improve and elevate all
							aspects of our House's performance. Despite these
							setbacks, the unwavering support and brotherhood
							that grew from the successes helped keep morale high
							and inspired us to aim even higher next year. The
							collective spirit extended far beyond the
							competition, bonding the boarding house and the
							wider College community in pride and unity.
						</p>

						<h2>Leadership</h2>

						<p>
							<strong>House prefects:</strong> Mila Xego (HOH),
							Luke Brooks (Deputy HoH), Vashiv Naidoo, Oliver
							Kirk, Nicholas Morrell, Noah Xego.
						</p>

						<p>
							In 2025, Nash House proudly had four School
							Prefects, including Custos Kamogelo Thobejane,
							Second Prefect Menzi Bongwe, and Head of School Siza
							Gule, all distinguished Nashotonians. Throughout the
							year, the house prefects worked tirelessly,
							dedicating themselves fully to serving and
							supporting the boys of Nash House. A standout moment
							was their heartfelt project to honour Nash House
							legend Joel Leotlela, who earned the prestigious
							distinction of wearing the iconic Green and Gold for
							the Junior Boks and was later selected for the
							BlitzBoks squad. To celebrate his remarkable
							achievements, the Prefects arranged for a framed
							game-worn jersey to be displayed prominently in the
							Common Room, ensuring his legacy continues to
							inspire all Nash boys. It is with immense pride that
							we announce the 2026 leadership team for Nash House,
							with Simon Musset appointed as Head of School and
							Ama Ntusbane as Custos, both distinguished Nash
							boys.
						</p>

						<p>
							Simon Mussett and Christopher Chapman, the latter
							being named Head of Nash House for 2026, have
							demonstrated exceptional leadership, particularly in
							water polo, while Simon also excelled on the first
							team rugby squad. Ama has been an outstanding
							athlete across multiple sports including basketball,
							rugby, hockey, and football, showcasing remarkable
							versatility and dedication. Beyond their athletic
							achievements, all three have made significant
							contributions to their Nash House portfolios,
							exemplifying the true spirit of leadership and
							commitment that Nash House stands for.
						</p>

						<p>
							We extend our deepest gratitude to our Housemaster,
							Mr Mathonsi, and The Assistant Housemaster, Mr
							Mattiuzzo, for their outstanding leadership and
							unwavering commitment to Nash House throughout the
							year. Their tireless dedication has been the
							cornerstone in shaping a nurturing and supportive
							environment where every boy feels respected, valued,
							and safe. Both have gone beyond the call of duty not
							only in guiding and mentoring the prefects but also
							in reaching out to every single member of the house,
							ensuring that no one feels overlooked or
							unsupported. Mr Mathonsi and Mr Mattiuzzo have
							created a culture of openness and trust, making Nash
							House not just a residence, but a true home for all
							its boys. Their encouragement, patience, and genuine
							care have fostered an atmosphere where individuals
							can develop their talents, build strong friendships,
							and grow into confident young men. Thanks to their
							leadership, the house has become a place where
							camaraderie, respect, and personal growth are
							celebrated every day. We are truly fortunate to have
							such dedicated role models who lead by example and
							continuously inspire all Nash House members to
							strive for excellence while enjoying their time
							together in a safe and welcoming community.
